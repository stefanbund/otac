# OTAC, the Open Trading Algo Consortium

OTAC publishes trading algorithms for bitcoin/alt-coin exchanges. We encourage micro-hedge funds to take part in the cryptocurrency boom, facilitated in-part by algo trading. 
We hope that by publishing algorithms for successful trading, that we will create an ecosystem of firms which accept large quantities of funds for management, thus enabling a boom in personal fiancial security beyond banks, brokerages and savings accounts.
